# Challenge

Catch me if you can

# Description

We got hacked... One of our servers got hacked. We found a trusted ssh public key on our server that doesn't belong to any employee of the company. Maybe you can figure some more out about the person who hacked into our servers?

# Solution

The challenge gives a public ssh key. The key gives the email of the person that hacked the server.
(devalexchen@gmail.com), the email hints to that alex chen is a developer, maybe we can search if he has a profile with a public email.


That gives us a user called codeNinja32[https://github.com/codeNinja32] in his status we can find the flag
